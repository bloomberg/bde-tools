repository are listed below, and described in detail in the 
[tool's documentation](https://bloomberg.github.io/bde-tools)

#### WAF

The [WAF](https://bloomberg.github.io/bde-tools) build system is a collection
of tools used to build BDE-style libraries and applications.  It contains the
build tool [waf](https://bloomberg.github.io/bde-tools/waf.html#quick-start)
and the [bde\_setenv.py](https://bloomberg.github.io/bde-tools/setwafenv.html)
script used to configure the build environment.

#### Option File Formatter

The bde\_opts\_format.py tool reformats BDE-style [option files](
https://bloomberg.github.io/bde-tools/bde\_repo.html#options-file-format).

#### Test Runner

The bde\_runtest.py tool exercises a test driver by running all of its cases.


## Other Tools

Several other tools are available in the 'contrib' area:

#### bdedox

The [bdedox](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde-tools/blob/master/contrib/bdedox)
tool generates Doxygen HTML from source code files written in BDE style.

#### gdb-printers

The [gdb-printers](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde-tools/blob/master/contrib/gdb-printers) module contains an add-in for the GDB debugger that provides
pretty-printers for a number of BDE components.
(More can be added by request!)
