The bdegen.py command line tool provides a generator that generates boilerplate
files and source code for BDE-style components, packages, and package groups.

Usage Syntax
------------
    bdegen.py ([g]roup|[p]ackage|[c]omponent|[r]epo) <name> [type]

Create A Component
------------------
To generate the boilerplate source files for a component and its associated
test driver, run this tool from the root directory of the package that will
contain the new component, specifying the camel-cased name of the main class or
'struct' contained in the component and (optionally) the component type, using
the following syntax:

    bdegen.py [c]omponent <class or struct name> [component type]

The following component types are currently supported:

* `[bsl]value[alloc]` - value-semantic type (default)
* `[bsl]attribute[alloc]` - attribute type
* `[bsl]mechanism[alloc]` - mechanism
* `[bsl]protocol` - protocol (abstract interface)
* `[bsl]util` - utility

If the component type is prefixed by 'bsl', the source code generated will be
specific to components in in the 'bsl' package group; otherwise, the source
code will be applicable to any package group above 'bsl'.

If the component type is suffixed by 'alloc' (when applicable), the generated
class will take an allocator.

The tool will generate the '.h', '.cpp', and '.t.cpp' file containing only the
boilerplate source code of the component.  The source code generated will
compile and link. In addition, the name of the component will be added to its
package's 'mem' file.

Note that the <application name>.dep contains the dependencies of the
application package, which by default contains 'bsl', 'bdl', and 'bde'.

Create A Package
----------------
To generate a package, run this tool from the directory that will contain the
new package, specifying the name of the package, using the following syntax:

    bdegen.py [p]ackage <package name> [package type]

The following package types are supported:

* `regular` - regular package (default)
* `application` - application package

The following directory structure and files will be generated for a regular
package:

    <working directory>
     |
     |--<package name>
          |
          |--package
              |
              |--<package name>.dep
              |--<package name>.mem
              |--<package name>.opts

The following directory structure and files will be generated for an application
package:

    <working directory>
     |
     |--<package name>
          |
          |--<package name>.m.cpp
          |
          |--package
              |
              |--<package name>.dep
              |--<package name>.mem
              |--<package name>.opts

If the working directory is a package group directory, then the .mem file of
that package group will be updated to contain the newly created package.

Create A Package Group
----------------------
To generate a package group, run this tool from your project root directory
specifying the name of the package group using the following syntax:

    bdegen.py [g]roup <group name>

The following directory structure and files will be generated by this tool:

    <working directory|project root>
     |
     |--<groupname>
          |
          |--group
              |
              |--<group name>.dep
              |--<group name>.mem

Usage Examples
--------------
Generate the boilerplate of a component and its associated test driver having
an abstract proctol named 'Session':

    blp_create.py component Session protocol

Generate the boilerplate of a package named 'bdeut':

    blp_create.py package bdeut

Generate the boilerplate of a package group named 'bde':

    blp_create.py group bde
