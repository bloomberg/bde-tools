Following packages should be installed in the system or into the local
virtualenv environement:

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -U --pre sphinx
pip install recommonmark
pip install pygments-markdown-lexer
```

documentation source tree.

## Internal documentation build environment

Bloomberg development machines have pre-configured sphinx environment with 
all necessary modules.  To load the environment:

```
source /bb/bde/documentation/sphinx_env/bin/activate
```

## Build 

The documentation site is generated by the provided Makefile by running
folowing command:

```
make internal
```

The generated site can be found in the build/html folder.

Developers in a Bloomberg environment can make a symbolic link to their 
`public_html` directory using:

```
ln -s $PWD/build/internal/html ~/public_html/bde-tools
```
