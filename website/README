Steps to set up webserver instance

Go to https://openstack.dnj1.bcpc.bloomberg.com/horizon/project/instances/

1) Create a VM with the interface, based on the "configured-webserver" snapshot.

2) Make sure its name is "results", and it's associated with an IP address (the
   rest of this assumes you used the same one, 100.127.4.161).

3) Make sure the /web_data partition is mounted on the webserver:
    ssh -i ~bdebuild/.ssh/bdebuild.pem ubuntu@100.127.4.161 \
            sudo mount /dev/vdb /vol001

4) Copy over any missing databases as bdebuild:
    scp -i ~bdebuild/.ssh/bdebuild.pem ~bdebuild/bs/nightly-logs/*/db/*.db \
           ubuntu@100.127.4.161:/web_data/db

5) Make sure the "bde-tools" checkout is up-to-date in the vm (again, as
   bdebuild):
    ssh -i ~bdebuild/.ssh/bdebuild.pem ubuntu@100.127.4.161
    cd /web_data/git/bde-tools
    git pull

6) If CGI scripts aren't loading correctly, make sure the apache configuration
   and root files match the contents of system-setup.tar.gz.
